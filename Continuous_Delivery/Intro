JENKINS PIPELINE
  - Is a collection of jenkins plugins that support doing Continuous Delivery.
  - Is it takes source code through a pipeline from source code all the way to production deployment.
  - Pipelines adheres to the best practice of infrastructure as code.
  
JENKINSFILE
  - A pipeline is implemented in a file that is kept in a source control along with the rest of the application code. This file is called JENKINSFILE
  
  - Pipelines has a Domain-Specific-Language(DSL) that is used to define the pipeline logic.
  - There are two styles of pipelines syntax you can use (You choose one or the other).
    - SCRIPT
    - DECLARATIVE

  Pipeline Stages: //Are large pieces of the CD process
    Build the code
    Test the code
    Deploy to Staging
    Deploy to Production
    
    - Stages are made up by steps:
    Pipeline Steps: //Are the individual tasks that make up each stage
      Execute a command
      Copy files to a server
      Restart a Service
      Wait for input from a human
      
  EXAMPLE:
  
   pipeline {
    agent any
    stages {
        stage('Build') {
            steps {
                echo 'Running build automation'
                sh './gradlew build --no-daemon'
                archiveArtifacts artifacts: 'dist/trainSchedule.zip'
            }
        }
    }
}

AUTOMATED DEPLOYMENT IN A PIPELINE
  - Define Stages for stages of the CD.
  - Then we need to define the steps or tasks for every stage.
